# PasswordGenerator

Most websites ask user to create an account and using the same one can make it easier for attackers to access them. I personally would rather use random passwords for sites that are less important. 

How to use:
    - Checkboxes are provided if your password requires an uppercase letter, number, or a special character (symbol)
    - Length of password is required and must be at least 8 characters long
    - Click the generate button for a random password
    - If you choose to save that password type in the website you are saving this password for and your username
    - This will save your password to a file SavedPasswords.txt in your current directory and create it if it does not exist yet
    
Improvements Needed:
    - Show passwords functionality to display all passwords in another tab
    - Delete buttons to remove unwanted information from the file
    - Improve design of GUI and visual appeal
    - Generate password using user input hints
    - Error-check each function
